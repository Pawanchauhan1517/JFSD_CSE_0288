          Trump's following his campaign promises, but they're threatening the

          Every day, Donald Trump shatters previous understandings of the
          presidency and America's role in the world. But in his rush to wield
          vast power and fulfill campaign promises, the new commander in chief
          is straining the rule of law and gambling with global stability.
          Before his second term began, it was assumed that a president wouldn't
          simply refuse to spend billions of dollars already authorized by
          Congress and deploy a private citizen, like Elon Musk, to obliterate
          huge government agencies enshrined in US law. The idea that the White
          House would simply ignore a court order was more a theoretical
          question for a law school seminar than a potential reality. Firing
          government aid workers living in world hotspots would have been
          unthinkable. As would disrupting a program credited with saving the
          lives of millions of HIV/AIDS patients.

          YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia has issued an apology on Monday following
          a controversial remark he made that sparked widespread criticism with
          calls for his podcast to be banned. Politicians, including Maharashtra
          Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Opposition leaders in the State,
          condemned him for misusing freedom of speech. Congress leader Vijay
          Wadettiwar criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for honouring Mr.
          Allahbadia, who boasts over 6 lakh followers on X, 4.5 million on
          Instagram, and more than 1 crore subscribers on YouTube, with a
          “National Creators Award” presented to him before the 2024 Lok Sabha
          election

          DeepSeek hasn't just disrupted OpenAI. Chinese tech giants are being
          upended too
        </h3>

          DeepSeek's advances have roiled global stock markets and AI players.
          Now, its influence is spreading quickly at home, with some of China’s
          biggest tech companies, many of which had been developing their own
          chatbots, racing to incorporate the open-source model into their own
          services. In early February telecoms giant Huawei said it would run
          DeepSeek on its own computing hardware composed of its Ascend computer
          processors, which are domestically produced. Some AI watchers have
          hailed this as a turning point, as it demonstrates that a
          high-performing model like DeepSeek no longer requires Nvidia’s most
          powerful chips to operate. “This partnership defies US sanctions by
          proving China can deliver globally competitive AI performance using
          domestically developed AI hardware and software stack, replacing
          Nvidia chips with Ascend chips,” analysts at Bernstein, an investment
          and research firm, wrote in a research note earlier this month.
